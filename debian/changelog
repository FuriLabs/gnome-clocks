jhbuild (2.28.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Loic Minier ]
  * Cleanups.
  * Ship scripts.
  * Don't set GNOME_MODULE as it equals the name of the source package.

  [ Emilio Pozuelo Monfort ]
  * New upstream release. Closes: #524504.
    - Use 'git rev-parse' rather than 'git-rev-parse'. Closes: #544642.
  * Ship install-check. Closes: #441008.
  * Uploaders list regenerated. Closes: #523542, #554071.
  * debian/control.in,
    debian/rules:
    - Stop shipping a copy of subprocess.py. Require python >= 2.4.
    - Switch to python-support.
  * debian/control.in:
    - Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.3, no changes needed.
    - Build depend on intltool >= 0.35.0.
    - Build depend on pkg-config, gnome-doc-utils and rarian-compat to build
      the documentation.
    - Make jhbuild arch any since install-check is a binary. Depend on
      ${shlibs:Depends}.
    - Recommend, and not suggest, git-core. Also recommend mercurial.
  * debian/watch:
    - Added.
  * debian/patches/01_import_from_pkgdatadir.patch:
    - Added, import jhbuild from pkgdatadir if everything else fails.
      This way we can ship the jhbuild private modules in /usr/sharejhbuild.
  * debian/jhbuild.docs:
    - Removed, the necessary docs are now installed by the upstream Makefile.
  * debian/rules:
    - Include autotools.mk and gnome.mk.
    - Remove all the manual build process, autotools.mk does everything now.
    - Install the jhbuild modules in /usr/share/jhbuild.
  * debian/install:
    - Install the modulesets and patches from here since the upstream build
      system doesn't install them.

jhbuild (0.0.svn.r1378-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Build, install, and clean the user manual; build-depend on xmlto.
  * Add a README.Debian documenting:
    - The audience for and the risks with jhbuild.
    - The obsolescence of the user manual.
    - Some configuration tips.
    - Why scripts/ isn't shipped.
    - Disk space usage.
  * Drop most TODOs from debian/rules.
  * New upstream snapshot to fix gnome-2.16 and gnome-2.18 build failures with
    Ekiga/CVS which needs a fresher pwlib and opal: now use tarballs instead.
    - Drop .cvsignore handling as these were removed upstream.
  * Fix doc build to not run multiple times.
  * New upstream snapshot to use the new gucharmap gnome-2-16 branch.

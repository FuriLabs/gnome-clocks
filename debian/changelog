jhbuild (0.0.svn.r1378-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Build, install, and clean the user manual; build-depend on xmlto.
  * Add a README.Debian documenting:
    - The audience for and the risks with jhbuild.
    - The obsolescence of the user manual.
    - Some configuration tips.
    - Why scripts/ isn't shipped.
    - Disk space usage.
  * Drop most TODOs from debian/rules.
  * New upstream snapshot to fix gnome-2.16 and gnome-2.18 build failures with
    Ekiga/CVS which needs a fresher pwlib and opal: now use tarballs instead.
    - Drop .cvsignore handling as these were removed upstream.
  * Fix doc build to not run multiple times.
  * New upstream snapshot to use the new gucharmap gnome-2-16 branch.
